The Cost of Missed Calls

Every missed call is a customer you won’t get back.

Lost revenue: Callers hang up and move on to your competitor.

Overwhelmed staff: Front-desk and floor teams can’t do two things at once.

After-hours gap: 70% of business calls happen when you’re busy or closed.

TalkServe ends that loss—automatically.
